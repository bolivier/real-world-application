# real-world frontend

An implementation of [Real World Application](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) frontend in Clojurescript/Re-frame

## Why?

I wanted to do a project in Clojurescript 100% from the ground up. I started this project with

```
$ lein new app real-world
```

and continued from there.  Not using any lein templates has been (somewhat) enlightening.
